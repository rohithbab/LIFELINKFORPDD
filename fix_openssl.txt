To fix OpenSSL in XAMPP:

1. Go to C:\xampp\apache\bin and find these files:
   - libeay32.dll
   - ssleay32.dll
   
2. Copy these files to C:\xampp\php

3. Make sure these lines are uncommented in C:\xampp\php\php.ini:
   extension=openssl
   extension=sockets

4. If php_openssl.dll is missing from C:\xampp\php\ext:
   - Download it from: https://windows.php.net/downloads/pecl/releases/openssl/
   - Choose the version matching your PHP version
   - Copy it to C:\xampp\php\ext

5. Restart Apache in XAMPP Control Panel

After making these changes, run test_email_debug.php to see detailed error messages.
